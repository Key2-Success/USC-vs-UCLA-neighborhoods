# USC vs UCLA neighborhoods
This project was done for my Stats 140SL midterm (the class is Practice of Statistical Consulting, which I took Fall of 2017, under Professor Vivian Lew).

## Lessons Learned
What I learned from this midterm, which was a short 1 hour timed test, were these key components for analyzing data when in a time crunch:
1. Don't clean variables that are not necessary for your analysis (this took up 20 minutes of my 60!).
2. Spend time creating one beautiful graphic instead of creating 3 mediocre ones (my second graph looks quite hideous, to be honest).

So rather than use this project as a basis of my data analysis, I use this project as a base on how I have learned to improve data analysis when given limited time.
